# DRAKON — Space Object Tracking & Collision Awareness Platform

### High-Level Product Showcase (Source Code Private)

DRAKON is a space situational awareness (SSA) interface designed to help operators visualize orbital environments,
monitor space objects, and understand potential collision risks with clarity and confidence.

> ⚠️ This repository contains a **public overview only**.  
> The full implementation, algorithms, and architecture remain private due to ongoing development and research sensitivity.  
> Recruiters and collaborators may request read-only access.

## 🌍 Overview

DRAKON transforms live TLE data into an interactive orbital visualization environment.  
It is built to assist with:

- **Monitoring satellites & debris in real time**
- **Understanding orbital congestion and proximity patterns**
- **Exploring orbital planes, density layers, and object metadata**
- **Experimenting with early collision-risk visualization concepts**

The goal is to make complex space operations data **intuitive, visual, and actionable** — bridging engineering depth with human-centered product design.

## 🔑 Core Capabilities (High-Level)

### **1. Global Orbital Visualization**

15,000+ satellites and debris objects rendered on a 3D globe with smooth interaction and filtering.

### **2. TLE-Based Orbit Propagation**

Real-time object paths generated using publicly available two-line-element datasets.

### **3. Orbital Plane Mapping**

View orbital planes (LEO/MEO/GEO/Custom) and understand traffic distribution.

### **4. Collision Density Layer**

A heatmap-like layer revealing zones of heavy orbital traffic and potential hotspots.

### **5. Object Search & Metadata**

Instant search + contextual information for satellites and tracked objects.

## 🎨 Product Philosophy

DRAKON is designed with a strong emphasis on:

- **Clarity over complexity**
- **Operational awareness in seconds, not minutes**
- **Minimal visual noise, maximum informational depth**
- **Scalable patterns suitable for mission-critical workflows**

---

## 🔒 Why the Code is Private

The underlying implementation includes:

- custom rendering logic
- TLE ingestion optimization
- data-decoupled visualization engine
- early collision-screening experiments
- internal research work

To prevent misuse and protect the integrity of the project, the source code is private.

**However, I’m happy to provide code access to hiring managers, founders, or collaborators.**
